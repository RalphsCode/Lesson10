
Hello, I'm Ralph Godkin, a dedicated software engineer currently honing my coding skills through a 
comprehensive software engineering bootcamp. 

With a strong foundation in website development and valuable experience in a sales role at a bank, 
I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and insights into finance, corporate culture, teamwork, 
and leadership. 

I believe in the power of continuous learning and hands-on practice to stay current in the ever-evolving 
tech landscape. If you or anyone you know is involved in the software field, I would greatly appreciate 
the opportunity to connect and exchange insights. 

Let's chat or email to explore how my diverse background can contribute to exciting software projects.
